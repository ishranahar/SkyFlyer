## 📌 Project Details

* **Type:** 2D Animation-Based Game
* **Course:** Computer Graphics (Section L)
* **Technologies:** C++, OpenGL

## 🎮 Game Summary

The player controls a bird flying across the sky while avoiding enemy drones, aircraft, and static buildings. Difficulty increases gradually as speed and level progress. Any collision results in **Game Over**.

## 🕹️ Key Features

* **Bird Control:** Up & Down arrow keys
* **Enemies:** Drones and aircraft spawn periodically
* **Obstacles:** Static buildings
* **Level System:** Speed increases with level
* **Score:** Based on survival time (real-time display)
* **Sound:** Collision and game-over effects
* **Controls:**

  * **P** – Pause/Resume
  * **R** – Restart after Game Over

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights

* OpenGL primitive-based rendering
* Timer-based animation
* Translation-based object movement
* Bounding-box collision detection
* Game states: Running, Paused, Game Over
